<h2>How I Approach Learning New Topics</h2>

<div class="glass-card">
<p>
Whenever I start learning something new, I avoid rushing.
I first try to understand why the topic exists and where it is used.
</p>

<p>
I break concepts into smaller parts, connect them with what I already know,
and only then move forward. This reduces confusion and builds clarity.
</p>

<p>
This method helps me retain knowledge longer and apply it better.
