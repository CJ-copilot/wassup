  <h2>Discipline vs Motivation</h2>

  <div class="glass-card">
    <p>
      Many people believe motivation is the key to success.  
      I used to think the same, but over time I realized that motivation
      is temporary — it comes and goes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Discipline, on the other hand, is reliable.  
      It helps you continue working even when you don’t feel inspired,
      excited, or confident.

    <h3>Why Motivation Is Not Enough</h3>
    <p>
      Motivation depends on mood, environment, and energy.
      On some days it is strong, but on other days it completely disappears.
      Relying only on motivation can break consistency.
    </p>

    <h3>How Discipline Helps</h3>
    <p>
      Discipline means showing up even when you don’t feel like it.
      It builds habits, routine, and long-term growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Small disciplined actions done daily lead to bigger results
      than short bursts of motivation.

    <h3>What I Practice Personally</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Fixed study and learning time</li>
      <li>✔ Small daily goals instead of big promises</li>
      <li>✔ Reviewing mistakes instead of avoiding them</li>
      <li>✔ Consistency over perfection</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>Connection With Taekwondo</h3>
    <p>
      Taekwondo reinforced this lesson strongly.
      Training continues whether motivation is high or low.
      Discipline creates strength, confidence, and control over time.
